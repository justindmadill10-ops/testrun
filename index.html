    <h1>THE UNSEMINARIAN</h1>
    <p>This space is a creative outlet where I explore theology from a layman’s perspective. My formal training is in architecture—I hold a Master of Architecture from Lawrence Technological University and am a Registered Architect in the state of Michigan. I mention that because I want to be clear: I’m not a theologian, pastor, or scholar. I don’t write with authority. I write out of love. <br> I love studying God’s Word, and I love making what I’m learning accessible to everyday people. For whatever reason, I’ve always been able to think theologically even without seminary training, and it’s from that in‑between place—curious, uncredentialed, but deeply invested—that this website exists. This is theology from someone who builds buildings for a living, thinks in plans and sections, and approaches Scripture with the same mix of rigor, wonder, and practicality. If that resonates with you, welcome. You’re in the right place..
